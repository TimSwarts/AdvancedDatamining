# Advanced Datamining
This repository contains code solutions for the tutorials
on machine learning provided by Dave Langers.
This repository is subdivided in chapters(H1, H2, ... etc).
Each chapter contains a jupyter notebook tutorial
(example: ``Werkcollege_v2021-H1.ipynb``) and a python script: ``model.py``,
which is the current version of the model used in the
jupyter notebook tutorials.
